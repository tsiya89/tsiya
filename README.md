# About Meüôé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
### üëã Hi, I'm Tsion Tilahun, but you can call me Tsiya!

##### I'm currently a software engineering student with an interest of web development. My focus right now is on front-end development, where I actively build responsive and engaging user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I enjoy bringing designs to life.

##### Beyond the frontend, I'm expanding my knowledge into backend technologies, such as Python and PHP to broaden my skills and to develop full-stack capabilities. I'm committed to continuous learning and believe in steadily growing my skills with each project and also I'm always putting in my best effort to understand and build impactful web projects! 

##### My goal is to always deliver my best work and evolve as a developer.
